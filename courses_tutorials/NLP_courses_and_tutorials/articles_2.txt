Determining optimum number of topics
What is the best way to determine k (number of topics) in topic modeling? Identify the optimum number of topics in the given corpus text is a challenging task. We can use the following options for determining the optimum number of topics:

One way to determine the optimum number of topics is to consider each topic as a cluster and find out the effectiveness of a cluster using the Silhouette coefficient.
Topic coherence measure is a realistic measure for identifying the number of topics.
Topic Coherence measure is a widely used metric to evaluate topic models. It uses the latent variable models. Each generated topic has a list of words. In topic coherence measure, you will find average/median of pairwise word similarity scores of the words in a topic. The high value of topic coherence score model will be considered as a good topic model.
